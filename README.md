Questions, goals, etc for the Calculator web app are:

1. buttons: 0-9, addition, subtraction,multiplication,division, parenthesis, equals, decimal.

2. design it like iphone's calculator app for easy ui (don't have to search for design).

3. what would happen if i calculate three values using the signs. would it calculate it first or show it as is
   ie. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 or 1 + 2 = 3 + 3 = 6?
4. how much characters can i show on the screen? is it the same as the width of the calculator body of the apple design?
   
5. how do you code the parenthesis or decimal as intended. Does it work since the calculations happens in back and the characters that we are showing are just for the user sake? (idk if this makes sense)

6. How would i make it better? (design, efficiency, user experience, etc.). Maybe make it so that a certain width shows more or less buttons just like the iphone calculator app - **Don't worry about this yet**.

1. the AC button is for ALL CLEAR all entry and C is for CLEAR the last entry (maybe just do clear all first for since it might be easier)
